Insider trading predictor

Does: Pull data from apis, clean and sort, do some basic statistics, automate updates to github

Will: Fix automation on home pc, Task Scheduler has permissions issues. Eleminate need for fetch_by_slug, time intensive. More robust commenting and type hinting. Trades class especially, but everything is rife with repetative and wasteful code. 

Want: Better (and fast) statistical analysis
